Supposed to be Intro
================

The code snippet below and its explanations cover various useful Windows functions and APIs that can be implemented using the C++ language for system programming purposes (aka not a Malware Development ðŸ˜‰). Here, we'll discuss the basic terms associated with these functions. If you're new to C++, don't worry, we'll walk through it together, as I'm also new to it (no, please learn some syntax first).
  

Since we are dealing with the Windows API, we need to use **Windows.h** as a header file which contains declarations for all of the functions in the Windows API. Also **iostream** is used for data input and output.  
Basic Syntax Skeleton for this blog
```c++
#include<Windows.h> # Import Windows API Functions
#include<iostream> # Input and Output
using namespace std; # Allows a program to use names for objections and variables from the standard library like  cout and endl

int main() # Main Function.
{
    system("PAUSE"); # Wait for the user to exit the program.
    return 0;
}
```
# Directories and Files
## Create a Directory
The **CreateDirectory** function creates a new directory on the specified path. The return type of the function is **BOOL** and it contains two parameters **lpPathName** and **lpSecurityAttributes**.

- **lpPathName:** Contains value for the path of the directory which needs to be created. Its data type is [**LPCTSTR**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-dtyp/f8d4fe46-6be8-44c9-8823-615a21d17a61) which means Long Pointer to Constant TCHAR String. It is commonly used in Windows API functions to pass string parameters.
- **lpSecurityAttributes:** Used to define the security attributes for the folder being created like defining who can access it and what operations they can perform. More info about it on [MSDN](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/aa379560(v=vs.85)). 

Syntax
```c++
BOOL CreateDirectory(
  [in]           LPCTSTR               lpPathName,
  [in, optional] LPSECURITY_ATTRIBUTES lpSecurityAttributes
);
```
Here on the above syntax, **[in]** means that it is an input parameter and  **[in, optional]** means that it is an optional input parameter which means we can set it as **NULL**. When the **lpSecurityAttributes** is set to Null, the directory gets a default security descriptor.

```c++
#include<Windows.h> 
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
BOOL bCreateDir;
createDir = CreateDirectory(
L"C:\\Users\\niraj\\Desktop\\Dir1",
NULL);

if (createDir == FALSE)
{
cout << "CreateDirectory Failed & Error No - " << GetLastError() << endl;
}

cout << "CreateDirectory Success" << endl;
getchar();
system("PAUSE");
return 0;
}
```

## Delete a Directory
```c++
#include<Windows.h>
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
BOOL bRemoveDir;

/* Delete Directory */
bRemoveDir = RemoveDirectory(L"C:\\Users\\niraj\\Desktop\\Dir1");
if (bRemoveDir == FALSE)
{
cout << "RemoveDirectory Failed & Error No - " << GetLastError() << endl;
}
cout << "RemoveDirectory Success" << endl;
system("PAUSE");
return 0;
}
```
