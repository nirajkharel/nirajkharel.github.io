`URLSession` caches HTTP responses on disk by default. The cache lands at `Library/Caches/<bundle-id>/Cache.db` - a SQLite file containing full response bodies and headers, including `Authorization`, `Set-Cookie`, and `X-Auth-Token` values. Any attacker with filesystem access reads every API response the app ever received without touching the network.

<br>**The shape**

The default `URLSessionConfiguration.default` inherits `URLCache.shared`, which is disk-backed with 50 MB of storage:

<img alt="NetworkCacheViewController.swift default URLSession config caching responses (highlight 1) and Authorization header cached (highlight 2)" loading="lazy" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nirajkharel/nirajkharel.github.io/master/assets/img/images/ios-nsurlcache-annotated.png">

<br>**Highlight 1** is `let config = URLSessionConfiguration.default` - default config enables a 50 MB disk cache backed by SQLite at `Library/Caches/Cache.db`; every response including those containing auth tokens is written to disk.

**Highlight 2** is `request.setValue("Bearer sk-prod-8f3k2j9x0q1w5e6r", forHTTPHeaderField: "Authorization")` - the Authorization header is part of the cached request object; `sqlite3 Cache.db .dump` on a jailbroken device recovers it in plaintext.

The response - status line, all response headers, body - goes into `Cache.db` as a `cfurl_cache_receiver_data` row. The `Authorization` header the app sent is stored in the request side of the same row.

<br>**Where the cache lives**

```
/var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/<UUID>/Library/Caches/<bundle-id>/Cache.db
```

Three tables matter:

```
cfurl_cache_response        - HTTP status + response headers
cfurl_cache_receiver_data   - response body (may be gzip-compressed blob)
cfurl_cache_blob_data       - overflow bodies, > 256KB
```

The request blob in `cfurl_cache_response` contains the full request headers - including whatever `Authorization` or session-cookie header the app sent.

<br>**Spotting it**

Grep the decompile (or binary strings) for `URLCache`:

```bash
nm Payload/VulnLabAppiOS.app/VulnLabAppiOS | grep -E 'URLCache|diskCapacity|memoryCapacity|removeCachedResponse'
# debug build — code is in the dylib:
nm Payload/VulnLabAppiOS.app/*.dylib | grep -E 'URLCache|diskCapacity|memoryCapacity|removeCachedResponse'
# debug build installed via Xcode — code is in the dylib:
nm Payload/VulnLabAppiOS.app/*.dylib | grep -E 'URLCache|diskCapacity|memoryCapacity|removeCachedResponse'
# debug build — code is in the dylib:
nm Payload/VulnLabAppiOS.app/*.dylib | grep -E 'URLCache|diskCapacity|memoryCapacity|removeCachedResponse'
```

No output, or output that never sets `diskCapacity: 0`, is the finding. The default disk capacity is 50 MB.

At runtime, hook the cache write:

```javascript
const NSURLCache = ObjC.classes.NSURLCache;
Interceptor.attach(NSURLCache['- storeCachedResponse:forRequest:'].implementation, {
    onEnter: function (args) {
        const req = new ObjC.Object(args[3]);
        console.log('[cache write] ' + req.URL());
    }
});
```

Every URL that gets cached fires this hook. Watch for authenticated endpoints - `/account`, `/transactions`, `/messages`.

<br>**Pulling the cache on a jailbroken device**

```bash
scp root@device:"/var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/<UUID>/Library/Caches/com.vulnlab.iosapp/Cache.db" .
sqlite3 Cache.db
```

Read the stored responses:

```sql
SELECT request_key, time_stamp FROM cfurl_cache_response;

-- Response body (may need hex → text conversion for gzip blobs)
SELECT hex(isDataOnFS), receiver_data FROM cfurl_cache_receiver_data LIMIT 5;
```

`request_key` is the full URL. `receiver_data` is the response body. For gzip-compressed bodies:

```bash
# Extract blob, decompress, read
sqlite3 Cache.db "SELECT writefile('/tmp/body.gz', receiver_data) FROM cfurl_cache_receiver_data LIMIT 1;"
gunzip /tmp/body.gz && cat /tmp/body
```

The output is the API response JSON - user profile, session token, account data, whatever the endpoint returned.

<br>**Via iTunes backup (no jailbreak required)**

The `Library/Caches/` directory is excluded from iTunes backups by default. However, a developer who moved the cache to `Documents/` (common workaround for size limits) or a misconfigured cache URL under `Library/Application Support/` does end up in backups.

Confirm via:

```bash
idevicebackup2 backup --full ./backup
ideviceinfo -u <UDID> -q com.apple.mobile.backup -k WillEncrypt
```

Then search the backup manifest for `Cache.db` entries.

<br>**The fix**

Two options depending on what the app needs:

```swift
// Option 1: ephemeral session - no disk cache at all
let config = URLSessionConfiguration.ephemeral
let session = URLSession(configuration: config)

// Option 2: per-request cache policy for sensitive endpoints
var request = URLRequest(url: sensitiveURL)
request.cachePolicy = .reloadIgnoringLocalAndRemoteCacheData

// Option 3: wipe the disk cache on exit / background
func applicationDidEnterBackground(_ application: UIApplication) {
    URLCache.shared.removeAllCachedResponses()
}
```

`URLSessionConfiguration.ephemeral` is the strongest - it never writes to disk for any request in that session. The tradeoff is no caching benefit, which is fine for any session that carries credentials.

<br>**Closing**

NSURLCache is the silent logger. The app never opts in to caching sensitive endpoints, it just never opts out. The audit step is one `strings` grep and one `sqlite3` query on a test device. The fix is one line - `URLSessionConfiguration.ephemeral` for any session that touches authenticated APIs.

Happy Hacking !!
