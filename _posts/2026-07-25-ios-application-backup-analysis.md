iOS backups are a frequently overlooked data exposure vector. When a user backs up their iPhone to a Mac or to iCloud, the backup includes every app's `Documents/`, `Library/Preferences/`, and `Library/Application Support/` directories. If an app stores session tokens, credentials, or PII in those locations without marking the files as backup-excluded, all of it is in the backup. The backup does not require device unlock to read on a Mac that has previously trusted the device.

<br>**What iOS backups include (and what they skip)**

Included by default:
- `Documents/` - any files the app saves there
- `Library/Preferences/` - `NSUserDefaults` plist files
- `Library/Application Support/` - CoreData databases, config files
- `Library/WebKit/` - sometimes contains cached webview state

Excluded by default:
- `Library/Caches/` - system-designated cache directory
- `tmp/` - scratch space
- Files explicitly marked with `NSURLIsExcludedFromBackupKey = true`

Keychain items are backed up in encrypted form keyed to the device if `ThisDeviceOnly` is not used. Items with `kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlockedThisDeviceOnly` are NOT backed up.

<br>**Taking a backup**

Connect the device over USB. Trust the computer if prompted.

```bash
# Full backup of all apps
idevicebackup2 backup --full .
```

The backup lands in a directory named by the device UDID. Each file inside is a hash-named blob.

Extract the backup into a readable directory tree:

```bash
idevicebackup2 unback . restore/
```

<br>**Navigating the backup**

The extracted tree groups files by domain. App sandbox data lands under:

```
restore/
└── AppDomain-com.vulnlab.iosapp/
    ├── Documents/
    ├── Library/
    │   ├── Preferences/
    │   │   └── com.vulnlab.iosapp.plist
    │   └── Application Support/
    │       └── VulnLabAppiOS.sqlite
    └── ...
```

`AppDomain-com.vulnlab.iosapp` maps directly to the app's sandbox container. The bundle identifier is the last component.

<br>**Finding secrets in the plist**

```bash
# Convert binary plist to XML and grep
plutil -convert xml1 \
  restore/AppDomain-com.vulnlab.iosapp/Library/Preferences/com.vulnlab.iosapp.plist \
  -o -

# Or just read it
cat restore/AppDomain-com.vulnlab.iosapp/Library/Preferences/com.vulnlab.iosapp.plist \
  | plutil -convert xml1 - -o - \
  | grep -E 'token|api_key|password|session'
```

In VulnLabAppiOS, the `NSUserDefaults` plist contains `session_token` and `api_key` written by `LoginViewController`. Both land in `Library/Preferences/com.vulnlab.iosapp.plist` and both appear in any iTunes or iCloud backup.

<br>**CoreData / SQLite extraction**

```bash
sqlite3 \
  "restore/AppDomain-com.vulnlab.iosapp/Library/Application Support/VulnLabAppiOS.sqlite" \
  ".tables"

sqlite3 \
  "restore/AppDomain-com.vulnlab.iosapp/Library/Application Support/VulnLabAppiOS.sqlite" \
  "SELECT * FROM ZUSERDATA;"
```

Any encrypted-at-rest flag in the CoreData model is app-level encryption, not filesystem encryption. If the app did not encrypt the SQLite contents itself, the rows are plaintext.

<br>**Frida script listing backup-eligible files**

At runtime, enumerate every file in the app sandbox and check whether it is excluded from backup:

```javascript
const fm  = ObjC.classes.NSFileManager['+ defaultManager'].call(ObjC.classes.NSFileManager);
const home = ObjC.classes.NSProcessInfo['+ processInfo'].call(ObjC.classes.NSProcessInfo)
    .environment().objectForKey_('HOME').toString();

// Walk Documents, Library, and Application Support
['Documents', 'Library/Preferences', 'Library/Application Support'].forEach(function(subdir) {
    const dir = home + '/' + subdir;
    const error = Memory.alloc(Process.pointerSize);
    Memory.writePointer(error, NULL);
    const files = fm.contentsOfDirectoryAtPath_error_(
        ObjC.classes.NSString.stringWithString_(dir), error);
    if (!files) return;
    for (let i = 0; i < files.count(); i++) {
        const name = files.objectAtIndex_(i).toString();
        const full = ObjC.classes.NSString.stringWithString_(dir + '/' + name);
        const urlVal = Memory.alloc(Process.pointerSize);
        const url = ObjC.classes.NSURL.fileURLWithPath_(full);
        const resErr = Memory.alloc(Process.pointerSize);
        Memory.writePointer(resErr, NULL);
        url.getResourceValue_forKey_error_(urlVal, 'NSURLIsExcludedFromBackupKey', resErr);
        const excluded = new ObjC.Object(Memory.readPointer(urlVal));
        console.log('[backup] ' + dir + '/' + name +
            ' excluded=' + (excluded.isNil() ? 'false' : excluded.toString()));
    }
});
```

Files that print `excluded=false` are backed up. Any secret-bearing file that is not excluded is a finding.

<br>**The missing Info.plist flag**

VulnLabAppiOS's `Info.plist` does not include `NSApplicationIsBackupAllowed = NO`. That flag disables app backup entirely:

```xml
<key>NSApplicationIsBackupAllowed</key>
<false/>
```

Setting it to `false` prevents the app's entire data container from being included in any backup. Use it when the app handles credentials, financial data, or health records. For apps where some files should be backed up (user-generated documents), leave the flag absent and mark sensitive files individually.

<br>**Fixing per-file exclusion**

Mark individual sensitive files as backup-excluded after creating them:

```swift
var url = URL(fileURLWithPath: sensitiveFilePath)
var resourceValues = URLResourceValues()
resourceValues.isExcludedFromBackup = true
try? url.setResourceValues(resourceValues)
```

Apply this to:
- Any file containing session tokens or credentials.
- The SQLite database if it stores sensitive user data.
- The `UserDefaults` plist if it stores anything beyond display preferences.

For `UserDefaults` specifically, move sensitive values to Keychain instead of trying to exclude the plist after the fact. The plist path changes with app updates and the exclusion flag must be re-applied.

<br>**Closing**

Backup analysis recovers plaintext secrets from any app that stores them in `Documents/` or `Library/Preferences/` without exclusion flags. The audit is a three-step loop: back up, navigate the domain directory, grep the plists. Any credential that appears in a backup is a finding.

Happy Hacking !!
